    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory, you will get acquainted to the basic visualization techniques for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). You will deal with charts to\n",
    "- analyze a data distribution, like **histograms**, **boxplots** and **violin plots**\n",
    "- explore relationships and (linear) correlations in your data, like **scatterplots** or **heatmaps**\n",
    "- visualize the trend and some salient information of a **time series**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right type of chart for the type of data at hand is a never ending job. Some [communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) took it seriously since a while. You will soon find yourself eager to test many approaches: this laboratory will help you getting started.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each main section of the notebook introduces one of the chart categories listed above. Within the sections, you will find a brief description of type of plot you are required to build, along with a short snippet of code that produces the chart on syntetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole notebook is written in **Python**. The code level is introductory: if your are a Python master, bear with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, some parts of the notebook are pre-compiled, we filled the boilerplate code for you. Although the notebook is sequential, each section is self-contained: feel free to skip back and forth you are more interested in specific parts.\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    " \n",
    "So, to recap. Let's say your client provides you and your team a large set of raw, unprocessed data and you are the one in charge to do a first EDA pass. And you happen to know Python.\n",

    "## Before we start: Python & Co.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is the *standard de-facto* ecosystem for data scientists and practitionaires. If I had to summarized its advantages over other languages like R, or even some GUI-enabled tools, I would say:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a large, well-documented standard library, and a *huge* number of third-part libraries for virtually *everything* you need\n",
    "- a large, supportive community with a lot of resources\n",
    "- modern Python keeps the syntax at a minimum. To run data science and visualization experiments, the python code almost reduces to *plain english*\n",
    "- a series of online tools that let you experiment with the language: you only need a Google Account to create [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook) Notebooks, and the same applies for [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/), and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory, we will three popular libraries: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/index.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy and Pandas let you easily handle numerical arrays and tabular data respectively.\n",
    "Simply put, NumPy is your best companion for the Geometry class, while Pandas provides you a table-like access to your data (with index and column names, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "They have been excellently covered by Andrea Pasini in the course Data Science Lab: process and methods at Politecnico di Torino. If you are interest, feel free to visit the [course website](https://dbdmg.polito.it/wordpress/teaching/data-science-lab-process-and-methods-2020-2021/) for slides and laboratories. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The most used library for data visualization in python is [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). However, in this laboratory, you will use [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).\n",
    "Seaborn is a matplotlib wrapper which provides simpler-to-use, high-level APIs to produce charts with better quality and lower effort.\n",
