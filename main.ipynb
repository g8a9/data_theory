    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory, you will get acquainted to the basic visualization techniques for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). You will deal with charts to\n",
    "- analyze a data distribution, like **histograms**, **boxplots** and **violin plots**\n",
    "- explore relationships and (linear) correlations in your data, like **scatterplots** or **heatmaps**\n",
    "- visualize the trend and some salient information of a **time series**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right type of chart for the type of data at hand is a never ending job. Some [communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) took it seriously since a while. You will soon find yourself eager to test many approaches: this laboratory will help you getting started.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each main section of the notebook introduces one of the chart categories listed above. Within the sections, you will find a brief description of type of plot you are required to build, along with a short snippet of code that produces the chart on syntetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole notebook is written in **Python**. The code level is introductory: if your are a Python master, bear with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, some parts of the notebook are pre-compiled, we filled the boilerplate code for you. Although the notebook is sequential, each section is self-contained: feel free to skip back and forth you are more interested in specific parts.\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    " \n",
    "So, to recap. Let's say your client provides you and your team a large set of raw, unprocessed data and you are the one in charge to do a first EDA pass. And you happen to know Python.\n",

    "## Before we start: Python & Co.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is the *standard de-facto* ecosystem for data scientists and practitionaires. If I had to summarized its advantages over other languages like R, or even some GUI-enabled tools, I would say:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a large, well-documented standard library, and a *huge* number of third-part libraries for virtually *everything* you need\n",
    "- a large, supportive community with a lot of resources\n",
    "- modern Python keeps the syntax at a minimum. To run data science and visualization experiments, the python code almost reduces to *plain english*\n",
    "- a series of online tools that let you experiment with the language: you only need a Google Account to create [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook) Notebooks, and the same applies for [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/), and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory, we will three popular libraries: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/index.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). Let's run the cell below to check and install all the dependecies for these libraries (do not worry about warnings)."
